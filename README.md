This is the latest version of the code behind

The original was written in Ruby and hosted on Dreamhost, until they
"upgraded" their server and broke my carefully crafted world.

This version is written in Elixir using the Phoenix web framework.

To start your new Phoenix application:

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.
